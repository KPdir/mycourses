### Course Description

The Coursera course, Data Analysis and Statistical Inference has been revised and is now offered as part of Coursera Specialization [Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics).

#### The goals of this course are as follows:
- Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.

- Use statistical software (R) to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.
- Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.

- Apply estimation and testing methods (confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) to analyze single variables and the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.

- Model and investigate relationships between two or more variables within a regression framework.

- Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.

- Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.
Complete a research project that employs simple statistical inference and modeling techniques.
